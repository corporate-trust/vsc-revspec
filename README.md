# Revspec

This open source VSCode extension is designed to support source code reviews. It does not contain a code analyzer, it is "only" a support for manual reviews.

## Features

* Add/Remove files to scope
* Add/Delete findings, containing:
  * Title
  * Description
  * Likelihood and Severity
* Automatic report generation, containing:
  * Overall stats (Seen code, Accepted code, â€¦)
  * Scope
  * Findings sorted by importance
